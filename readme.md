# Snake Game - intro

This is a simple snake game that i would like to create using proprietary methods. 

Main goal of a project is to learn how to code in real world, so any sujjestions on improving the workflow are GREAT

## Project workflow as of now

1. I imagine a code architecture and create tests working as an architect

2. I create issues explaining what should be done to pass the created test - consequently resolving a thing that i've imagined

3. Me and my collegues write code to pass the tests working as junior software developers

4. When the job on some section is done, the code is pushed to a corresponding developers branch, trigggering github actions to run tests and a project itself

5. If all tests pass developer may continue working on the next issue

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

if there are some sujjestions regarding the workflow itself PLEASE create a issue regarding it and i will probably add it to a workflow

# Guideline for participants

## Junior developer workflow
0. Go to project section of a repository

1. Pick an issue that you want to solve, assign yourself to it. and place it to "In progress" column

2. If this issue depends on some other issues, go ahead and assign yourself to a step that you would like to work on

3. in a testing section of the game, find a corresponding file, and remove the comment on a definition of the test

4. Make shure the test is triggered

5. Make changes in the codebase so that a test would pass

6. Push all the cahges to your branch

7. Wait till the tests are run through github actions

8. If all checks pass - you may merge your branch to a develop branch directly, or by creating a PR in case if you are not shure of something.

9. Keep on going from step one!
